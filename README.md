# Recombination Detection Program (RDP) 5

The source code has been generously made available by Prof. Darren Martin. If you have any questions regarding the compilation and use, please raise an issue.

## How to compile

You will need to build your own project files for all of these (they will be specific to your installation and file system on your computer)..  You will not be able to build project files in VC15 for the VC6 code and you will not be abe to build a working project file in VB.Net for the VB6 code.  

If you want the source code to work you will need to install VB6, VC6 (you may be able to get both these packaged in an old version of visual studio) and Visual Studio 15. Make sure all three of the development environmnets are installed before you start trying to build the project files).
